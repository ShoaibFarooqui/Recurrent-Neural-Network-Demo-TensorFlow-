# Recurrent-Neural-Network-Demo-TensorFlow-
Demonstration of a Recurrent Neural Network using TensorFlow. Randomly generated data with two features is fitted to a model with one dense layer with 5 neurons and rectified linear unit activation function. An output latyer condensing to one neuron with a sigmoidal activation curve.  Additional modules include sklearn, pandas, and matplotlib.

## Performance
The RNN model is fitted to a training dataset using the ```adam``` optimizer for 50 epochs. This proves to be beneficial for minimizing lss as the testing data subset had an **accuracy score of 95.36%** and a **loss score of 0.1236**
