# Recurrent-Neural-Network-Demo-TensorFlow-
Demonstration of a Recurrent Neural Network using TensorFlow. Randomly generated data with two features is fitted to a model with one dense layer with 5 neurons and rectified linear unit activation function. An output latyer condensing to one neuron with a sigmoidal activation curve.  Additional modules include sklearn, pandas, and matplotlib.
